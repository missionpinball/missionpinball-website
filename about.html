        <h2>Podcast: Learn about MPF on the Boom Go Pinball Podcast</h2>
        <p>In April 2016, MPF developer Brian Madden spent 3 hours talking to
        Adam Godfrey on the <a href=
        "http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/boom-go-pinball-podcast">Boom Go
        Pinball Podcast</a> about the Mission Pinball Framework. They talked
        about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How MPF came to be</li>
            <li>Our approach to pinball software</li>
            <li>"Programming" with config files versus "real" code</li>
            <li>What's new in MPF 0.30</li>
            <li>A walk-through of how you implement game logic in MPF</li>
            <li>Our long-term vision for the future of MPF</li>
        </ul>
