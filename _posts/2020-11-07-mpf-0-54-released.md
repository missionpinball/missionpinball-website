title: MPF 0.54 has been released
tags: [0.54, MPF]
---
Today, we released MPF 0.54.
0.53 users should be able to upgrade with small or no changes to their config.
This post only mentions some highlights and you can alternatively read the
[full release notes](https://docs.missionpinball.org/en/dev/versions/release_notes.html)
in the [MPF docs](http://docs.missionpinball.org).

Breaking changes in config
--------------------------

- Deprecated ``ball_locks`` device has been removed.
  Use ``multiball_locks`` or ``ball_holds`` instead.
- Space-separated lists have been removed.
  Use comma-separated lists or yaml lists instead (with or without spaces).
  MPF sticks to YAML conventions here and allows all kinds of legal YAML lists (which does not include space-separated lists).
- Deprecate ``playfield_active`` tags on shots.
  Those tags are only required for switches which are not part of shots or devices (so almost none).
  MPF will complain and you might have to remove the tag in that case.
- MPF will complain on event handlers with the same name as a switch.
  This should not happen in practice and has been done to catch typical user error
  (i.e. using the event ``s_my_switch`` instead of ``s_my_switch_active``).
- Diagnostics menu (switch, coil, light) is now a sub-menu in service mode.

New Features
------------

- P3-ROC support for GPIO interface
- Production-optimized code packaging for making non-dev builds
- ShowPlayer queue support for deferred sequential playback

New Config Options
------------------
- Accrual `advance_random_events` to advance an accrual block randomly
- Bonus mode `keep_multiplier` setting now supports conditions
- Carousel mode `block_events` and `release_events` to prevent accidental selection changes with flipper press + flipper cancel
- DropBank `ignore_switch_hits_ms` to prevent switch counting when the bank resets
- LightPlayer now accepts a `key` argument to track specific instances
- RandomEventPlayer `fallback_event` to play if all listed events are conditional and none evaluate true
- Show `start_running` boolean to play the first step of a show and immediately pause it
- SoundLoop `loop_start_at` and `loop_end_at`
- TextInput `block_events` and `release_events` to prevent accidental inputs with flipper press + flipper cancel

Bug Fixes
---------
