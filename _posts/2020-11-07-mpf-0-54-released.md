title: MPF 0.54 has been released
tags: [0.54, MPF]

Today, we release MPF 0.54.
0.53 users should be able to upgrade with small or no changes to their config.
This post only mentions some highlights and you can alternatively read the
[full release notes](http://docs.missionpinball.org/en/dev/versions/release_notes.html)
in the [MPF docs](http://docs.missionpinball.org).

Breaking changes in config
--------------------------

- Deprecated ``ball_locks`` device has been removed.
  Use ``multiball_locks`` or ``ball_holds`` instead.
- Space-separated lists have been removed.
  Use comma-separated lists or yaml lists instead (with or without spaces).
  MPF sticks to YAML conventions here and allows all kinds of legal YAML lists (which does not include space-separated lists).
- Deprecate ``playfield_active`` tags on shots.
  Those tags are only required for switches which are not part of shots or devices (so almost none).
  MPF will complain and you might have to remove the tag in that case.
- MPF will complain on event handlers with the same name as a switch.
  This should not happen in practice and has been done to catch typical user error
  (i.e. using the event ``s_my_switch`` instead of ``s_my_switch_active``).
- Diagnostics menu (switch, coil, light) is now a sub-menu in service mode.

New Features
------------

- Support for Ubuntu 20.04 (see install instructions)
- Batched lighting updates for supported platforms
- Delayed pulse-on-hit rule (for supported platforms)
- Error codes for many common errors, especially config file errors
- Flipper EOS support for both with and without hold coils
- Glow effect for MC displays @seanirby
- High Scores, audits, credits and earnings can now be reset in service mode
- Initial support for Python 3.8 (only MPF; Kivy in MPF-MC still only supports up to Python 3.7)
- MPF-MC Interactive mode debug dump
- New default ball search behavior
- New prepackaged font option ``DSEG14Classic-Italic``: a 14-seg font similar to System 11 displays @seanirby
- RandomEventPlayer now supports conditional events in the event list
- Pin2DMD support for RBG lights and 192x64 displays
- P3-ROC support for GPIO interface
- Production-optimized code packaging for making non-dev builds
- ShowPlayer queue support for deferred sequential playback
- ShowPool configuration for pooling shows like other assets
- Sequential light loading for simplified light chain addresses
- Separated config loading and parsing to prevent race conditions and improve references
- Serial LED support for OPP
- Service mode now includes Audits, Adjustments, and Utilities menus by default
- Support for Stern Spike 2 platforms

New Config Options
------------------
- Accrual `advance_random_events` to advance an accrual block randomly
- Bonus mode `keep_multiplier` setting now supports conditions
- Carousel mode `block_events` and `release_events` to prevent accidental selection changes with flipper press + flipper cancel
- DropBank `ignore_switch_hits_ms` to prevent switch counting when the bank resets
- LightPlayer now accepts a `key` argument to track specific instances
- RandomEventPlayer `fallback_event` to play if all listed events are conditional and none evaluate true
- Show `start_running` boolean to play the first step of a show and immediately pause it
- SoundLoop `loop_start_at` and `loop_end_at`
- TextInput `block_events` and `release_events` to prevent accidental inputs with flipper press + flipper cancel

Bug Fixes
---------

- BCP event handlers for active mode change events 
- Fixed StateMachine bug that prevents MPF Monitor from connecting 
- Fixed issue with `#` character in config values @seanirby 
- Fixed VPX `set_fade()` function for consistency with other platforms @Wolfmarsh 
- FlasherPlayer now defaults to "on" to play default color, instead of "white"
- Lazy-load zip image pools
- Improved messaging and context for errors
- Improved motor device to track last known position and prevent undesired moves
- Improved support for additional priority in conditional events
- Improved support for fade configuration in lights
