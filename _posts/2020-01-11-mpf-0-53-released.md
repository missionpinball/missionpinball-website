tags: [0.53, MPF]
---
Today, we release MPF 0.53 as a maintainance release to 0.52.
0.51 users should be able to upgrade with small or no changes to their config.
This post only mentions some highlights and you can alternatively read the
[full release notes](https://docs.missionpinball.org/en/dev/versions/release_notes.html)
in the [MPF docs](http://docs.missionpinball.org).

Breaking changes in config
--------------------------

- We fixed validation of animations. You might get a validation error with
  `repeat: -1`. Change it to `repeat: false`. See the [change in the docs](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-docs/commit/6a141ec4434a0904d92f05bcbce1fe345513c018).
- We changed `active_time` of ball_save from ms to secs. In case you did not use a unit here this might change the time. [Details](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/pull/1463).

Breaking changes in custom code
-------------------------------

- [Machine variables changed](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/pull/1394).
- [Achievement state changed](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/pull/1429).


Python 3.4 support dropped
--------------------------

MPF 0.53 no longer supports Python 3.4 because most of our dependencies dropped
support for 3.4.

Tested documentation
--------------------

Documentation snippets are automatically tested now.
They generally do not crash MPF and we also show you the test case to see what else is tested.
See our [blog post about tested examples](http://missionpinball.org/2019/12/20/tested-example-in-the-docs.html) for details.

VPX Support
-----------

You can test your game with VPX as hardware platform.
See our [blog post about VPX](http://missionpinball.org/2019/05/25/virtual-pinball-and-mpf.html) for details.

IDE Support
-----------

To increase developer productivity with MPF we created a MPF language server
which works with multiple IDEs such as VSCode, IntelliJ, Emacs and many more.
See [the MPF language server repo](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-ls/) for details.
We will create more documentation and blog posts about this soon.
